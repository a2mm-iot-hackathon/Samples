# Smart Garage
### By: Vedanth and Abhishek
## How It Works:
### The Smart Garage is a garage door system that opens only when the homeowner presents a hand signal, and has his mobile phone present with him. The phone connects to the home wifi, and secures the home from burglaries.
## The Better Security:
### Because your mobile phone is needed (in addition to the hand gesture) to open your garage, your house is protected from wild animals, children, or criminals who may know the hand gesture needed to gain access to your house.
## What Is Our Purpose:
### There are about 2.5 million burglaries a year, and 66 percent of them are home break-ins. We want to ensure home safety for all.
